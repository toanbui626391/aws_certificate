This can occur if a consumer processes a message and acknowledges it, but then fails before marking it as processed. To achieve this, consumers can keep track of the offsets and ensure messages are not skipped, even if it means handling duplicates in the application logic. This is a common choice for many applications that cannot afford to lose data but can handle duplicates.\n",

    "Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the same primary key. This way, the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Kafka Log Compaction Note:\n",
    "In Apache Kafka, log compaction is a mechanism that ensures that the log files (topics) do not grow indefinitely by removing old or redundant records. Specifically, it retains the latest version of a record for each key in the topic, and removes older versions (i.e., older messages with the same key). This helps to keep the topic size manageable and provides an efficient way to store only the most recent state of each record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about Log Compaction:\n",
    "1. Log Segments: Kafka topics are divided into partitions, and each partition is made up of log segments. These log segments contain messages that are appended in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key-based Cleanup: In log-compacted topics, Kafka tracks records with unique keys. If a record with the same key is appended to the log later, it will overwrite the previous record for that key. Kafka keeps the last version of each key, so the log essentially maintains the most up-to-date state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Retention of the Latest Value: Unlike the regular time-based retention policy (where messages are retained for a specific duration or size), log compaction focuses on retaining only the latest value for each key in the topic. The compaction process removes any older versions of records with the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compaction vs. Deletion: Compaction is not the same as deletion. Deletion refers to removing entire messages, whereas compaction removes older versions of records, but retains at least the most recent one. For example, if you have a message with a key userID=123 and a value of name=John, and later a message with the same key but value name=Alice, the old message for userID=123 with name=John will eventually be deleted, and only name=Alice will remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Triggering Compaction: Compaction is an asynchronous process that runs in the background. It doesn't happen immediately after a new message arrives but is instead triggered periodically based on factors like the size of the log, a configurable time interval, or manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log compaction in Kafka is controlled through several configuration options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. cleanup.policy: This property defines the log cleanup policy for a topic. It can be set to compact (log compaction) or delete (time-based retention). For log compaction, you would set this property as:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. min.cleanable.dirty.ratio: This configuration controls how much of a log segment must be \"dirty\" (i.e., containing messages that can be deleted or compacted) before compaction is triggered. It’s used to tune the compaction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. segment.bytes: The maximum size of a log segment. When this size is reached, a new segment is created, and the compaction process may be triggered on older segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. delete.retention.ms: Even in compacted topics, Kafka keeps records that are marked for deletion. This configuration defines how long Kafka should keep messages marked for deletion before they are permanently removed."

    "    - Cons: There is no guarantee that the message is successfully written to Kafka. If the broker is down or the message fails to reach Kafka, the producer will have no way of knowing, leading to potential data loss.\n",
    "- acks=1 (Leader acknowledgment):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - With acks=1, the producer waits for an acknowledgment from the leader replica of the partition after the message has been successfully written to the leader broker.\n",
    "    - The leader replica is responsible for replicating the message to other followers, but the producer doesn't wait for replication to happen—just for the leader to acknowledge.\n",
    "    - Pros: It provides a balance between throughput and reliability. There's a guarantee that the message is written to the leader replica, but not necessarily to any followers.\n",
    "    - Cons: If the leader replica fails after acknowledgment but before the message is replicated to followers, there is a risk of message loss. However, the failure would not affect the message being available to consumers, because once the leader acknowledges, the message is considered successfully written.\n",
    "- acks=all (Full acknowledgment / All replicas acknowledgment):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When acks=all (or acks=-1), the producer waits for an acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas (ISRs) of the partition, meaning the message must be replicated to all the brokers that are part of the in-sync replica set (the followers that are up-to-date and in sync with the leader).\n",
    "    - Pros: This provides the strongest durability guarantees. The message is guaranteed to be replicated to all available replicas before the producer receives an acknowledgment. This ensures that no messages are lost, even if a failure happens after the message is written to the leader but before it is consumed by a consumer.\n",
    "    - Cons: This comes at the cost of higher latency and lower throughput. The producer has to wait for all replicas in the ISR to acknowledge the write, which can slow down the process, especially in cases of network latency or when replicas are lagging behind."

It achieves this by assigning a unique ID to each produce request and maintaining a sequence number for each producer-partition pair. This prevents duplicate messages due to network issues or producer retries."

    "Kafka doesn't delete messages individually. Instead, it uses a retention policy to manage message deletion. Messages are retained either for a configurable amount of time or until the topic reaches a certain size. Once the retention limit is reached, Kafka deletes messages in bulk by removing whole segments of the log file. For more fine-grained control, Kafka also supports log compaction.\n",
