    "### 1. What is Apache Kafka?\n",
    "Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows for publishing, subscribing to, storing, and processing streams of records in real-time. It's designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data pipelines. Kafka is often used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications."

    "\n",
    "1. Producer: Publishes messages to Kafka topics.\n",
    "2. Consumer: Subscribes to topics and processes the published messages.\n",
    "3. Broker: A Kafka server that stores and manages topics.\n",

    "### 3. What is a topic in Kafka?\n",
    "A topic in Kafka is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it. Topics are split into partitions for improved scalability and parallel processing."

    "### 4. What is a partition in Kafka?\n",
    "A partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to. Each partition is a structured commit log, and records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the offset. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally and provide parallel processing capabilities."

    "ZooKeeper is used for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers. It serves as a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. ZooKeeper keeps track of the status of Kafka cluster nodes, Kafka topics, and partitions."

    "### 6. What is a broker in Kafka?\n",
    "A broker is a Kafka server that runs in a Kafka cluster. It receives messages from producers, assigns offsets to them, and commits the messages to storage on disk. It also services consumers, responding to fetch requests for partitions and responding with the messages that have been published."

    "### 7. How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?\n",
    "Kafka ensures fault tolerance through data replication. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance. One of the servers is designated as the leader, which handles all read and write requests for the partition, while the others are followers that passively replicate the leader."

    "### 8. What is the difference between a Kafka consumer and consumer group?\n",
    "A Kafka consumer is an application that reads data from Kafka topics. A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to consume data from one or more topics. The key difference is that each message is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. This allows for parallel processing and load balancing of topic consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka Consumer\n",
    "- A Kafka consumer is an individual application or process that subscribes to one or more Kafka topics and reads messages from them. Each consumer maintains its own offset, which indicates the last message it has processed. This allows consumers to track their position in the stream of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka Consumer Group\n",
    "- A Kafka consumer group is a collection of one or more consumers that work together to consume messages from Kafka topics. The key characteristics of a consumer group include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load Balancing: Kafka distributes the partitions of a topic among the consumers in a group. Each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group at a time, which helps in parallel processing and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fault Tolerance: If a consumer in a group fails, Kafka will automatically reassign the partitions it was consuming to other consumers in the group, ensuring that message consumption continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offset Management: Consumers in a group share the offset management. The group keeps track of the offsets of messages consumed across all its members, allowing for coordinated consumption."

    "### 9. What is the purpose of the offset in Kafka?\n",
    "The offset is a unique identifier of a record within a partition. It denotes the position of the consumer in the partition. Kafka maintains this offset per partition, per consumer group, allowing each consumer group to read from a different position in the partition. This enables Kafka to provide both queue and publish-subscribe messaging models."

    "### 10. How does Kafka handle message delivery semantics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kafka provides different message delivery semantics to accommodate various use cases, allowing users to choose the right balance between performance and reliability. The primary delivery semantics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At-most-once Delivery\n",
    "In this mode, messages may be lost but are never delivered more than once. This happens if a consumer reads a message but fails before processing it, leading to potential data loss. This mode is fast because it doesn't require any acknowledgment after processing. It is suitable for scenarios where losing messages is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At-least-once Delivery\n",
    "In this mode, every message is guaranteed to be delivered at least once, but it may be delivered multiple times. This can occur if a consumer processes a message and acknowledges it, but then fails before marking it as processed. To achieve this, consumers can keep track of the offsets and ensure messages are not skipped, even if it means handling duplicates in the application logic. This is a common choice for many applications that cannot afford to lose data but can handle duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Exactly-once Delivery\n",
    "This mode guarantees that each message is delivered exactly once, without duplication or loss. Achieving this requires a combination of idempotent producers, transactional messaging, and careful management of offsets. While this is the most robust option, it can introduce some overhead and complexity. It’s particularly useful in scenarios like financial transactions where duplicates could lead to significant issues."

    "- Consumer Group Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The consumer joins the specified group via the group.id configuration. This allows multiple instances of the consumer to share the load of consuming messages from partitions.\n",
    "- Manual Offset Commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The offset is committed only after the successful processing of the message and the commit of the transaction. This ensures that a message is not marked as processed until it has been fully handled.\n",
    "- Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Errors during processing result in the transaction being aborted, which prevents any partial writes or duplicate processing. This ensures robust error handling and recovery.\n",
    "- Polling Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The consumer continuously polls for messages. This loop can be enhanced with backoff strategies or other logic depending on your application's requirements.\n",
    "- Graceful Shutdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The finally block ensures that resources are cleaned up properly, closing the consumer and flushing the producer.\n"

    "- transactional.id: A unique ID for the producer’s transactions. Each producer instance must have a unique ID to manage its transactions.\n",

    "- Kafka automatically balances the load across multiple brokers and partitions, so when you have multiple partitions in your topic, the producer distributes messages across them. This happens naturally when using partition keys.\n",
